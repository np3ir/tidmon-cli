"""Restricted unpickling for importing third-party session files.

Ported from tiddl-elvigilante (tiddl/core/utils/safe_pickle.py).

``pickle.load()`` on an untrusted file is a remote-code-execution primitive: the
opcode stream can import arbitrary modules and call arbitrary callables while it
is being loaded. tidmon only needs the *data* inside OrpheusDL's
``loginstorage.bin`` (nested dicts/lists of strings and numbers), so we unpickle
it through an allowlist that permits only plain builtin container/scalar types
and refuses everything else with ``pickle.UnpicklingError``.
